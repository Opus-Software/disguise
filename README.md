# Disguise

Disguise is a project made with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9 that provides a user interface for the [Mountebank](http://www.mbtest.org/) server, facilitating the usage and interactions with the API.

## Install and Setup

### Requirements
- [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) Version 12
- [Angular-CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) Version 9
- [Mountebank](https://github.com/bbyars/mountebank) Version 2.2

### Installation

After installing the Node.js, install the Angular-CLI using the npm package manager:
```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

Clone the project's repository and in the cloned folder run the command to install the dependencies of the project:
```bash
npm install
```

Then serve the project with the Angular-CLI and it's ready to use:

```

### Setup

The UI will be hosted in *http://localhost:4200* and the default port considered for the Mountebank server is 2525. To change the Mountebank location, modify the *mb* object in the *src/app/shared/constants.ts* file:
```typescript
public static mb = 'http://localhost:2525';
```

## Usage

### Imposters Page

This is the page where you can manage the imposters present in the Mountebank server. You can visualize the informations of all the imposters and their stubs, add new imposters and delete existing ones. You can also add new singular stubs to imposters, edit and delete existing ones.

You can export the actual state of the Mountebank server, saving all the current imposters and stubs, to a json file. It is also possible to import a configuration json file, adding the imposters and stubs defined in it to the running Mountebank server.

If an imposter has the attribute *recordRequests* set to true, you can visualize all their recorded requests. The requests are shown in a list with their respective informations like timestamp, headers and request body.

### Logs Page

This is the page where you can visualize the logs returned by the Mountebank server. The logs are presented in a table where you can filter them by the port number, the type of the log, the imposter related to the log and the log message.
